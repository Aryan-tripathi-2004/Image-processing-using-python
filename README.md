# Image-processing-using-python
This is my 1st year minor project which is based on image processing . The full project write in the python language. <br>
This project is based on image processing so you have to install opencv in your system, otherwise it will show errors to you. <br>
for install open cv in your system you have to run this command (pip install opencv-python) in your system command prompt or terminal. <br>
